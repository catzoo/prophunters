# About

This gamemode was created by Mechanical Mind. [Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260275546)

This fork separates the taunt menu into addons, allowing players to taunt in any gamemode. This also removed the teams check, so hunters and props both can taunt the same taunts.
